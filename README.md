# Web Slide Show

I wrote this for a clients waiting room to just display various content on a monitor. There is one folder where you just drop all content you wish displayed. This can be images and videos for now, but the app is easilly extensible to display any file type.

The files are sorted and played in alphabetic order.

Additionally I will setup a cloud sync client so that all files coppied in a specific user folder on a remote computer will be displayed.

This is a Python flask application running in debug mode on a single board computer (Orange pi), but can run on any OS and any low end hardware that can play a video in a browser.
